## Possible Attacks on Active Directory

### 1. Password Attacks
Weak password policies can allow brute-force or password spraying attacks.

### 2. Privilege Escalation
Improper group membership can lead to users gaining admin rights.

### 3. Lateral Movement
Once an attacker compromises one user, they can move across the domain.

## Defensive Measures Implemented
- Strong password policies via GPO
- Role-based access control
- Limited file permissions
